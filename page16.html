                Vikram was the name of a king. He ruled over a city on the banks of
Godavari River. He was very famous for his bravery and courage.
People loved him because he always rendered justice.
One day a sage came to the court of Vikram and gifted him a fruit.
The king handed it over to his treasurer. Thereafter, the sage kept
coming to the court daily to gift a fruit to the king. The king could not
understand the reason behind this behaviour. But still he did not try to

                Once Upon a time there lived a king named Chandrakant. He is very brave
                and kind king. He was taking good care of his subjects. Everyone was living
                with peace in his kingdom.
                Once a guard came to him and told him that “Huzoor! you must alert our
                soldiers, as enemy might attack our country within few days”. Chandrakant
                asked him how could he say before the moment. The guard didn’t reply
                anything.
                Few days went away. Suddenly neighbour country attacked Chandrakant’s
                Kingdom , but as his soldiers were alert. They fought bravely and defeat the
                opponent. Chandrakant remembered the advice of the guard.
                After finishing war he came back to the palace. He was relaxing on his bed at
                the night. He decided to give good reward to the guard next day.
                Next day, he called a guard. Guard came very happily to receive his reward.
                King gave him 1000 gold coins and asked him how you got an idea enemies
                were going to attack on our kingdom. Guard replied “Sir I can see future
