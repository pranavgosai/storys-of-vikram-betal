                The royal announcement about the princess wedding was made stated that the
                suitors would have to take certain tests. The announcement was made in all
                the neighbouring kingdoms.
                When young handicapped man named Kurupshana from Jayanagar heard it.
                His mother died soon after he was born, and his father took a second wife. His
                step mother kept his name Kurupshana, which means ugly looking. His
                stepmother ill-treated him much. It was seldom that he even got a full meal.
                She knew that the boy, with his handicap, would not be much use to her.
                He decided to go to Kanchannagar. Few princes had were there
                Kanchannagar. They were guessing what kind of tests the princess would put
                them through. The time came to announce the details of the tests. The Princess
                Indumati came to the stage and sat next to the king.

                Prime Minister got up from his seat and faced the princely suitors. "Several
                suitors are present here to win the hand of princess Indumati. It is her wish
                that they are put to certain tests and Whoever succeed in the test will qualify
                to wed her. You all can see the wall in front of you. You have to climb the
                wall and jump down into the three- tiered cage of sharp knives. The important
                thing is, while doing so, you must not injure yourself. There should not be a
                single scratch on your body from the blades of the knives."
                Many princes took a good look at the high wall as well as the cage of knives.
                The wall looked too high for them; the cage was placed deep down below; and
                the space between the knives was very small. None dared even to make an
                attempt. As they went back to their seats.
