                Once upon a time there was born a beautiful daughter, Mandaravati, to a very
                famours priest. When the daughter grew of age, the father was worried about
                her marriage.Once, three eligible bachelors came to the father and each asked
                him for the hand of the daughter. Each of them threatened to kill himself lest
                the daughter be married off to any other of the three. The father decided not to
                marry her off to anyone.
                One day, she caught a very high pitched fever and died suddenly. All three of
                them, grief-struck, cremated the body of Mandaravati. One of them decided to
                stay there and slept on the ashes of Mandaravati. The other took her bones and
                went to the Ganges. The third became an ascetic and wandered off.

                soldiers, as enemy might attack our country within few days”. Chandrakant
                asked him how could he say before the moment. The guard didn’t reply
                anything.
                Few days went away. Suddenly neighbour country attacked Chandrakant’s
                Kingdom , but as his soldiers were alert. They fought bravely and defeat the
