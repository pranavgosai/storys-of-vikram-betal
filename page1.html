                Vikram was the name of a king. He ruled over a city on the banks of
                Godavari River. He was very famous for his bravery and courage.
                People loved him because he always rendered justice.
                One day a sage came to the court of Vikram and gifted him a fruit.
                The king handed it over to his treasurer. Thereafter, the sage kept
                coming to the court daily to gift a fruit to the king. The king could not
                understand the reason behind this behaviour. But still he did not try to
                find out the sage's intentions.
                However, one morning, Vikram noticed a monkey sitting on the
                palace wall and gave the fruit to it. The monkey had started eating the
                fruit when suddenly a dazzling gem fell out of it. The King was very
                surprised. He immediately ordered his treasurer to get him all the
                fruits kept in the storage. The fruits had gone bad but when the king
                had them crushed, each one of them yielded a precious gem. The
                generous King donated all these gems to the poor and waited for the
                sageâ€™s visit to the court.

                        The next day, the sage visited the court of Vikram with yet another
                        fruit.
                        Vikram welcomed the sage and asked him "Your Holiness! Can you
                        please tell me why you have been giving me such precious gifts?
                        Without good reason, I cannot accept any gifts from you."
                        The sage replied, "I need the help of a brave man for a spiritual goal.
                        Will you help me?" Vikram readily agreed to this. So the sage said,
                        "O King, please come to the burial ground on the next moonless
                        night. It is at a distance of 20 miles from here. I will wait for you
                        under a banyan tree." Vikram agreed to follow the instructions.
