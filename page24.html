                It was a dark night and was raining from time to time.Gusts of wind shook the
                trees. There were strange noises and in between the thunderclaps the moaning
                of jackals could be heard.Flashes of lightning revealed fearsome faces and

                like a boy, and given training in the use of arms an
                warfare. It was certain that whoever wed her would
                also become the ruler of Kanchannagar. The princes
                of many of the neighbouring kingdoms cherished a
                desire to marry Indumati, who was, besides
                everything else, extremely beautiful.
                Whenever the king broached the subject of
                marriage, Princess Indumati, would hesitate to
                give him a definite answer, but one day Indumati said yes to his father, "Yes,
