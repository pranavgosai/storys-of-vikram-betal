                It was a dark night and was raining from time to time.Gusts of wind shook the
                trees. There were strange noises and in between the thunderclaps the moaning
                of jackals could be heard. Flashes of lightning revealed fearsome faces and

                keep your promise if you had given one to anybody. You’ll realize the futility
                of the whole thing if only you listen to my story."

                extremely strong and courageous. He was a good ruler and cared about his
                people very much as he would not do anything unjust. His subjects were
                happy and contented. They had no problems. His queen, Prema, gave birth to
