                Once upon a time there lived a rich brahmin by name of Vishnuswamin, who
                was performing a huge sacrificial rite. He had three sons who were each very
                fastidious about three specific things. The eldest was fastidious about food,
                the second about women and the third about beds. Vishsnuswamin wanted a
                tortoise for his sacrifice. So he sent his three sons to get one. They did find
                one but each of them refused to touch it and bring it back home, as each
                claimed to be as fastidious as the other.
                Well then to decide, they approached the king with this matter of deciding
                who among them was the most fastidious. He decided to test them all. He
                invited the first one, to a very special feast prepared very exquisitely. But the
                first son, refused to touch the food claiming that the he smelt burnt corpses in
                the rice. On investigation, the king found that the grains of which the rice was
                cooked was from a field near a cremation ground. The king was impressed.

                and kind king. He was taking good care of his subjects. Everyone was living
                with peace in his kingdom.
                Once a guard came to him and told him that “Huzoor! you must alert our
                soldiers, as enemy might attack our country within few days”. Chandrakant
                asked him how could he say before the moment. The guard didn’t reply
                anything.
                Few days went away. Suddenly neighbour country attacked Chandrakant’s
                Kingdom , but as his soldiers were alert. They fought bravely and defeat the
                opponent. Chandrakant remembered the advice of the guard.
                After finishing war he came back to the palace. He was relaxing on his bed at
                the night. He decided to give good reward to the guard next day.
