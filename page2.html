                Once upon a time there lived a rich brahmin by name of Vishnuswamin, who
                was performing a huge sacrificial rite. He had three sons who were each very
                fastidious about three specific things. The eldest was fastidious about food,
                the second about women and the third about beds. Vishsnuswamin wanted a
                tortoise for his sacrifice. So he sent his three sons to get one. They did find
                one but each of them refused to touch it and bring it back home, as each
                claimed to be as fastidious as the other.
                Well then to decide, they approached the king with this matter of deciding
                who among them was the most fastidious. He decided to test them all. He
                invited the first one, to a very special feast prepared very exquisitely. But the
                first son, refused to touch the food claiming that the he smelt burnt corpses in
                the rice. On investigation, the king found that the grains of which the rice was
                cooked was from a field near a cremation ground. The king was impressed.

                    <td width="65%">
                        He then decided to test the second son by sending a very very pretty and
                        beautiful concubine, to him. But the second son sent her away saying that she
                        was smelling like a goat. On investigation, the king found that she had been
                        fed goat milk when she was a child. The king was impressed.
                        Then he decided to test the third son, by letting him sleep in a bed with seven
                        huge mattresses. In the middle of the night, the third son awoke with a lot of
                        pain and a red mark on his shoulder. On verifying, it was found that there was
                        a piece of hair in the bed below the seven mattresses. The king was impressed
                        with all three and could not decide who was best but instead decided to use
                        the skill of all three in his court and hired them. So Vishnuswamin could not
                        complete his sacrifice.
