                The Betaal then narrated this story. The ruler of Kishanagar, Rajendra, was
extremely strong and courageous. He was a good ruler and cared about his
people very much as he would not do anything unjust. His subjects were
happy and contented. They had no problems. His queen, Prema, gave birth to
a beautiful daughter, Sona.
Being an only child, Sona enjoyed a lot of freedom and was brought up like a
boy. She grew up clever not only in studies but in the use of the bow and
arrow and sword. She learnt the art of self-defence. When she reached
marriageable age, her parents began searching for a suitable husband for her.

                But Sona disagreed to their proposal as she had some definite ideas and views.
                She said to her parents that ,"Dear Father, I want that my husband should be
                one who is highly skilled in fighting and who is able to overpower, me in
                fight. Suppose if our kingdom face an enemy in the future, he should be able
                to fight & defeat them in war. If you agree to this condition then, you may
                make an announcement".
                The King & Queen were very proud to hear about their daughter's
                thoughts.The announcement was made in Kishanagar as well as in the
                neighbouring kingdoms. Thinking that Sona is only a girl,and it should not be
                a difficult to win a fight with her, many suitors came forward to accept her
                challenge as they also knew that Sona being the only heir they would have
                complete sway over the kingdom once they married her.
