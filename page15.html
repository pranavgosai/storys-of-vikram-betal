                It was a dark night and was raining heavily and there were strange noises from
                every where and voice of the moaning of jackals could be heard.
                Although there was a bad atmosphere king Vikramaditya did not fear a bit.
                He climbed the tree to bring the corpse down and soon he began to walk with
                the corpse lying on his shoulder.
                The Betaal spoke: "O King , I pity you as you are making untiring efforts
                without relaxing as if you wish to achieve something. Instead of enjoying a
                comfortable sleep in your palace you’re still coming after me”
                King didn’t speak anything because any word from his mouth would keep
                Betaal right back on the tree.
                So Betaal starts his story……….

                and kind king. He was taking good care of his subjects. Everyone was living
                with peace in his kingdom.
                Once a guard came to him and told him that “Huzoor! you must alert our
                soldiers, as enemy might attack our country within few days”. Chandrakant
                asked him how could he say before the moment. The guard didn’t reply
                anything.
                Few days went away. Suddenly neighbour country attacked Chandrakant’s
                Kingdom , but as his soldiers were alert. They fought bravely and defeat the
                opponent. Chandrakant remembered the advice of the guard.
                After finishing war he came back to the palace. He was relaxing on his bed at
                the night. He decided to give good reward to the guard next day.
                Next day, he called a guard. Guard came very happily to receive his reward.
