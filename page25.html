                It was a dark night and was raining heavily and there were strange noises from
                every where and voice of the moaning of jackals could be heard.
                Although there was a bad atmosphere king Vikramaditya did not fear a bit.
                He climbed the tree to bring the corpse down and soon he began to walk with
                the corpse lying on his shoulder.
                The Betaal spoke: "O King , I pity you as you are making untiring efforts
                without relaxing as if you wish to achieve something. Instead of enjoying a
                comfortable sleep in your palace you’re still coming after me”
                King didn’t speak anything because any word from his mouth would keep
                Betaal right back on the tree.

                Long long ago, Kanchannagar was being ruled by King Chandradeep . His
                daughter was Indumati . Being an only child, the princess was brought up like
                a boy, and given training in the use of arms an warfare. The princes of many
                of the neighbouring kingdoms cherished a desire to marry Indumati, who was,
                extremely beautiful.
                Whenever the king broached the subject of marriage, Indumati said "Yes,
                but... Whoever marries me must be strong and brave. And he must succeed in
                the tests that I give."
                Indumati, then she listed out what kind of tests she was contemplating for her
                suitors. The king was horrified. "Don’t insist on any such test, They’re all
                hazardous. No one will come forward to undergo the tests for fear their life.
                Just forget about them."
                Indumati said, "Don't worry father! All those who said that they love me than
                their life will certainly take these tests.”
